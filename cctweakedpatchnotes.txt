[patch notes]

./src/main/java/dan200/computercraft/shared/peripheral/modem/wired/WiredModemPeripheral.java#L222
- missing `getTypeLocal()` which calls methods in `WiredModemLocalPeripheral.java`
- missing `setIDLocal( @Nonnull int id )` which calls methods in `WiredModemLocalPeripheral.java`
- missing `setNameLocal( @Nonnull String name )` which calls methods in `WiredModemLocalPeripheral.java`
- peripheral ID of wired modem comes up as 0 or duplicated when cloned by worldedit

./src/main/java/dan200/computercraft/shared/peripheral/modem/wired/WiredModemLocalPeripheral.java#L36
- missing `getConnectedType()` which returns the type of peripheral connected
- missing `setConnectedID( @Nonnull int newid )` which changes the private id (not fine)
- missing `setConnectedName( @Nonnull String newname )` which concatenates peripheral type and private id (not fine)
- `string name` unnecessarily became `@Nonnull String newname` for every method, breaking a tonne of mods from 1.16.2

./src/main/resources/assets/computercraft/textures/block
- Change the following files to have even dark crimson red texture with python PIL
  - cable_*.png
  - computer_command_*.png
  - disk_drive_*.png
  - monitor_advanced-*.png
- Change the following files to have odd dark bluish gray texture with python PIL
  - speaker_*.png
